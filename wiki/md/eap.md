# EAP: Architecture Specification and Prototype

 Our project aims to redefine what it means to be online and have questions. Our goal is to ensure that every user feels comfortable asking questions and confident that they will receive fast and constructive answers in a friendly environment. We will have a rating system to ensure only the best and most helpful answers according to the community get to the top.

## **A7: Web Resources Specification**

This artefact documents the architecture of the **4NSWERS** web application, detailing the catalog of web resources, their properties, and the format of JSON responses. This specification adheres to the OpenAPI standard using YAML.  
It includes CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for each resource implemented in the vertical prototype.

### **1. Overview**

An overview of the complete web application is presented, identifying the modules and their corresponding functionalities. The detailed web resources are included in the OpenAPI specification for each module.

#### **Modules**
- **M01: Authentication**  
  Manages user authentication, including registration, login, and logout processes. Provides secure access control to restricted features.

- **M02: Home and Navigation**  
  Organizes navigation across the application, offering pages like home, popular questions, urgent questions, new questions, personalized recommendations, and a Hall of Fame.

- **M03: Questions Management**  
  Enables users to create, view, edit, delete, and vote on questions. Questions serve as the central content type in the application.

- **M04: Answers Management**  
  Supports adding, editing, and deleting answers for questions. Includes features to vote on answers (aura votes) and track their impact.

- **M05: User Profiles**  
  Allows users to manage their profiles, including viewing profile details, editing personal information, and updating passwords.

- **M06: Search**  
  Provides search functionality to locate questions based on titles or body content, streamlining the discovery process for users.

- **M07: Voting System**  
  Includes the mechanisms for voting on both questions (yeah votes) and answers (aura votes), allowing users to interact with content.
